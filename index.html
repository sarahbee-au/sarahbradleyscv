  <h3>My Background</h3>
  <p>Customer Service is like a second language to me and no task is ever too big or too small. Iâ€™m proactive, switched on and have a strong thirst for personal and professional development. Over the past 3 years in my previous employment, my confidence, leadership and dedication allowed me fast- track advancement into 5 separate roles and promotions. This included call centre operator, call centre assistant team leader, team leader, supervisor and finally service manager. I am driven and have a proven track record of being committed to success and achieving goals.<br><br>
  I am naturally self-motivated and have sound capabilities in independently managing a medium sized team of 20+ alongside large- scale technical projects. I can operate complex systems, maintain administrative functions and implement system and employee changes with ease. I also enjoy collaborating with department managers, business executives and third parties whilst improving company processes, procedures and assisting with business growth.</p>
